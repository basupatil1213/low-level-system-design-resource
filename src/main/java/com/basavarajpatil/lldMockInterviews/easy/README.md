# 🟢 Easy Level Mock Interviews

This section contains entry-level Low-Level Design problems perfect for junior to mid-level developer interviews. These problems focus on fundamental object-oriented programming concepts and basic design patterns.

## 🎯 Learning Focus

### Core Concepts
- **Class Design**: Creating well-structured classes with clear responsibilities
- **Encapsulation**: Proper use of access modifiers and data hiding
- **Inheritance & Composition**: When to use each approach
- **Polymorphism**: Interface-based programming and method overriding
- **Exception Handling**: Graceful error management
- **Basic Design Patterns**: Factory, Singleton, Strategy

### Interview Skills
- **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding problem statements
- **Incremental Development**: Building solutions step by step
- **Clean Code**: Writing readable and maintainable code
- **Testing Mindset**: Considering edge cases and error scenarios

## 📁 Available Problems

## 🚀 How to Practice

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Read the problem statement thoroughly
- Identify key requirements and constraints
- Ask clarifying questions (even to yourself)
- Define the scope clearly

### Step 2: Design the Solution
- Identify main entities and their relationships
- Choose appropriate design patterns
- Plan the class hierarchy
- Define interfaces and contracts

### Step 3: Implement and Test
- Start with basic functionality
- Gradually add complexity
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Refactor for better design

### Step 4: Review and Improve
- Check adherence to SOLID principles
- Look for code smells and refactor
- Consider extensibility and maintainability
- Document your design decisions

## 📊 Problem Characteristics

| Problem | Classes | Patterns | Key Learning |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Vending Machine | 7 | Encapsulation, State Management | Object interaction, Error handling |
| Document Reader System | 8 | Factory, Singleton, Strategy | Pattern combination, File I/O, Type safety |

## 🎓 Interview Preparation

### Common Questions for Easy Level
1. **Design a [specific system]** - Focus on basic functionality
2. **How would you handle [specific scenario]?** - Error cases and edge conditions
3. **What if we need to add [new feature]?** - Extensibility and maintainability
4. **Walk me through your class design** - Explanation and justification

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Correctness**: Does the solution work as expected?
- **Design Quality**: Are classes well-designed with clear responsibilities?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, readable, and well-organized?
- **Error Handling**: Are edge cases and errors handled appropriately?
- **Extensibility**: How easy is it to add new features?

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before Coding
- Spend 15-20% of time on requirements and design
- Draw simple diagrams if helpful
- Think about the main use cases first
- Consider what can go wrong

### While Coding
- Start with the simplest version that works
- Add one feature at a time
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Test as you go

### Code Quality
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Add comments for complex logic

### Communication
- Explain your design decisions
- Walk through your code clearly
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Ask for feedback and clarification

## 🔄 Next Steps

After completing easy level problems:

1. **Review Solutions**: Compare your approach with provided solutions
2. **Practice Variations**: Try modifying requirements slightly
3. **Time Yourself**: Work on completing problems within time limits
4. **Mock Interviews**: Practice explaining your solutions out loud
5. **Move to Medium**: Graduate to more complex problems
