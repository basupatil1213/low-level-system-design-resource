# üè≠ Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their exact classes. It encapsulates object creation logic and promotes loose coupling.

## üéØ Problem Statement

When you need to create objects but don't want to expose the instantiation logic to the client, and you want to refer to the newly created object through a common interface.

## üí° Solution

The Factory pattern suggests creating objects through a factory method instead of direct constructor calls. This method can decide which class to instantiate based on input parameters.

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

```
Interface/Abstract Class
    ‚Üë
Concrete Products
    ‚Üë
Factory (creates products)
    ‚Üë
Client (uses factory)
```

## üìÅ Implementations

This directory contains two comprehensive Factory pattern implementations:

### üîî [Notification System](notificationSystem/)
A communication system supporting multiple notification channels.

**Components:**
- **`Notification`** (Interface) - Contract for all notification types
- **`EmailNotification`** - Email-specific implementation
- **`SMSNotification`** - SMS-specific implementation  
- **`NotificationFactory`** - String-based factory for creating notifications
- **`Client`** - Demonstration of usage patterns

**Key Features:**
- String-based type identification
- Exception handling for unsupported types
- Easy extensibility for new notification channels
- Simple factory method approach

### üí≥ [Payment System](PaymentSystem/)
A financial transaction system handling multiple payment methods.

**Components:**
- **`Payment`** (Interface) - Contract for all payment methods
- **`UPIPayment`** - UPI/Digital wallet implementation
- **`PayPalPayment`** - PayPal gateway integration
- **`CreditCardPayment`** - Credit card processing
- **`PaymentFactory`** - Enum-based factory for creating payments
- **`PaymentType`** (Enum) - Type-safe payment method identification
- **`Client`** - Demonstration of payment processing

**Key Features:**
- Enum-based type safety
- Modern Java switch expressions
- Compile-time validation
- Financial domain modeling

## üîß Key Features

- **Encapsulation**: Object creation logic is encapsulated
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new notification types
- **Loose Coupling**: Client doesn't depend on concrete classes
- **Single Responsibility**: Factory handles object creation

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Notification System
```java
// Create email notification
Notification emailNotification = NotificationFactory.getNotification("email");
emailNotification.send("Welcome to our service!");

// Create SMS notification
Notification smsNotification = NotificationFactory.getNotification("sms");
smsNotification.send("Your OTP is 123456");
```

### Payment System
```java
// Process UPI payment
Payment upiPayment = PaymentFactory.getPaymentMethod(PaymentType.UPI);
upiPayment.pay(299.99);

// Process PayPal payment
Payment paypalPayment = PaymentFactory.getPaymentMethod(PaymentType.PAYPAL);
paypalPayment.pay(149.50);
```

## ‚úÖ Advantages

1. **Loose Coupling**: Client is decoupled from concrete classes
2. **Easy Extension**: New notification types can be added easily
3. **Centralized Creation**: All object creation logic in one place
4. **Code Reusability**: Factory can be reused across different clients
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to creation logic affect only the factory

## ‚ùå Disadvantages

1. **Complexity**: Adds extra layer of abstraction
2. **Code Overhead**: More classes and interfaces to maintain
3. **Inflexibility**: Hard to change factory behavior at runtime

## üéØ When to Use

- When you have a family of related products
- When object creation is complex
- When you want to hide creation logic from clients
- When you need to support multiple product variants
- When you want to achieve loose coupling

## üîÑ Variations

1. **Simple Factory**: Static method that creates objects
2. **Factory Method**: Subclasses decide which class to instantiate
3. **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects

## üß™ Running the Examples

### Notification System
```bash
# Compile and run the notification system
javac notificationSystem/*.java
java notificationSystem.Client
```

Expected Output:
```
Email Notification: User created successfully!
SMS Notification: User created successfully!
Notification type not supported: push
```

### Payment System
```bash
# Compile and run the payment system
javac PaymentSystem/*.java
java PaymentSystem.Client
```

Expected Output:
```
Paid 143.0 via PayPal
Paid 286.0 via UPI
Paid 143.0 via credit card
Unsupported payment type
```

## üéì Interview Questions

1. **Q**: What is the Factory Design Pattern?
   **A**: A creational pattern that creates objects without exposing instantiation logic to clients.

2. **Q**: When would you use the Factory pattern?
   **A**: When you need to create objects but want to decouple creation logic from client code.

3. **Q**: What's the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory?
   **A**: Factory creates one type of object, Abstract Factory creates families of related objects.

4. **Q**: How does Factory pattern promote loose coupling?
   **A**: Clients depend on interfaces/abstract classes rather than concrete implementations.

5. **Q**: Compare string-based vs enum-based factories
   **A**: Enum-based provides compile-time type safety, prevents typos, and offers better IDE support compared to string-based approaches.

6. **Q**: How would you extend the payment system for international markets?
   **A**: Use Abstract Factory pattern to create region-specific payment ecosystems with localized payment methods.

## üîç Pattern Comparison

| Aspect | Notification System | Payment System |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Type Safety | String-based (runtime) | Enum-based (compile-time) |
| Extensibility | Manual string handling | Automatic enum validation |
| Error Handling | Runtime exceptions | Compile-time checks |
| IDE Support | Limited | Full auto-completion |
| Maintenance | Prone to typos | Type-safe refactoring |
| Use Case | Simple notifications | Financial transactions |
