# 🎨 Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices and provide a common vocabulary for developers.

## 📚 Categories

### 🏗️ Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **[Factory Pattern](creational/factory/)** - Creates objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **[Singleton Pattern](creational/Singleton/)** - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access

## 🎯 Why Use Design Patterns?

1. **Reusability**: Solutions can be reused across different projects
2. **Communication**: Common vocabulary among developers
3. **Best Practices**: Time-tested solutions to common problems
4. **Maintainability**: Makes code more organized and easier to maintain
5. **Flexibility**: Provides flexible solutions that can be adapted

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each pattern directory contains:
- Complete implementation with examples
- Detailed README explaining the pattern
- Use cases and when to apply the pattern
- Code examples with client demonstrations

## 📖 Study Guide

### For Interviews
1. **Understand the Problem**: What problem does the pattern solve?
2. **Know the Structure**: Key participants and their relationships
3. **Implementation**: Be able to code from scratch
4. **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios where pattern applies
5. **Trade-offs**: Benefits and drawbacks of using the pattern

### Common Interview Questions
- "Implement the Singleton pattern"
- "Design a notification system using Factory pattern"
- "When would you use the Observer pattern?"
- "Explain the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory"
